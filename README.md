Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.

ðŸ‘‰**How does Machine Learning work**

A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives new data, predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.

ðŸ‘‰**Classification of Machine Learning**

At a broad level, machine learning can be classified into three types:

**Supervised learning**

**Unsupervised learning**

**Reinforcement learning**

ðŸ‘‰Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:

**Classification**

**Regression**

ðŸ‘‰In unsupervised learning, we don't have a predetermined result. The machine tries to find useful insights from the huge amount of data. It can be further classifieds into two categories of algorithms:

**Clustering**

**Association**

ðŸ‘‰**Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action
