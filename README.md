## Introduction

Data science is a rapidly growing field that encompasses various techniques and algorithms for extracting insights and making predictions from data. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Jupyter Notebook files that illustrate the implementation of different machine learning algorithms.

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and focuses on a specific algorithm. It includes step-by-step explanations and code examples to facilitate understanding and implementation. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, these notebooks can serve as valuable resources for exploring and experimenting with machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithms

The repository currently includes the following Machine Learning algorithms :

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. K-Means Clustering 
8. K-Fold Cross Validation
9. Naive Bayes
10. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
11. Bagging Ensemble
12. Saving Model to a File

Each Algorithm has its dedicated Jupyter Notebook file that provides an overview, theoretical background, and practical implementation of the algorithm.

## Usage

To use the Notebooks in this Repository, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine. You can clone this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MachineLearning.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the specific Algorithm's Notebook and open it using Jupyter Notebook. Run the code cells sequentially to understand the algorithm's implementation and observe the outputs.

Feel free to modify the Notebooks, experiment with different Datasets, and adapt the code to your specific use cases.
