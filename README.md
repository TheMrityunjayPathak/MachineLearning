🖥️ **What is Machine Learning?**

- Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

- ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. 

- As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. 

- Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.

❓ **How does Machine Learning Works?**

- A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives new data, predicts the output for it. 

- The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.

🫧 **Classification of Machine Learning**

At a broad level, machine learning can be classified into three types:

- **Supervised learning**

- **Unsupervised learning**

- **Reinforcement learning**

❓ **Why Should we learn Machine Learning?**

- Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems. 

- It allows computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. 

- This makes it possible to build systems that can automatically improve their performance over time by learning from their experiences.

🎯 **There are many reasons why learning machine learning is Important:**

- Machine learning is widely used in many industries, including healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. 

- By learning machine learning, you can open up a wide range of career opportunities in these fields.

- Machine learning can be used to build intelligent systems that can make decisions and predictions based on data. 

- This can help organizations make better decisions, improve their operations, and create new products and services.

- Machine learning is an important tool for data analysis and visualization. 

- It allows you to extract insights and patterns from large datasets, which can be used to understand complex systems and make informed decisions.

- Machine learning is a rapidly growing field with many exciting developments and research opportunities. 

- By learning machine learning, you can stay up-to-date with the latest research and developments in the field.

1️⃣ **Supervised Learning**

🔹 Supervised learning is a class of problems that uses a model to learn the mapping between the input and target variables.

**Supervised Learning can be grouped further in two categories of Algorithms :**

- **Classification**

- **Regression**

2️⃣ **Unsupervised Learning**

🔹 In an Unsupervised learning problem the model tries to learn by itself and recognize patterns and extract the relationships among the data.

**Unsupervised Learning can be grouped further in two categories of Algorithms :**

- **Clustering**

- **Association**

3️⃣ **Reinforcement Learning**

🔹 Reinforcement learning is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action.
